      <h2>REVIEW: Silent Hills PT</h2>

      <p><em>This game is no longer available</em></p>

<div class="col-xs-7">
      <p> Silent Hill was meant to have another entry in the series. However due to "complications" it had to be cancelled.
        Only the <strong><em>Playable Tester</em></strong> (also known as <strong><em>PT</em></strong>) was all fans had of the game.
        Although the PT is no longer available to download, we are still going to review it and discuss what could have become of Silent Hills
        (the game that the PT was for). </p>

<h3>The Game</h3>
        <p>The game starts off with the Playable Character waking up in a room. They get out of the room and walk around a house corridor.
          when they arrive to the last door and open it they are back in the room where they started, tring to escape the house will lead to
          the Character waking up at the start again. Although everytime the character goes through the corridors in circle more and more
          supernatural events take place in the rooms and looking back would cause a game over since they would see a monster that would kill
          them. </p>

          <p>Some people describe it as though the character is descending to madness.</p>
