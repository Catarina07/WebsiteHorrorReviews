      <h2>REVIEW: Silent Hills PT</h2>

<blockquote>
      <p><em>This game is no longer available</em></p>
      </blockquote>

<div class="col-xs-7">
      <p> Silent Hill was meant to have another entry in the series. However due
        to "complications" it had to be cancelled.Only the <strong><em>Playable
          Tester</em></strong> (also known as <strong><em>PT</em></strong>) was
          all fans had of the game.Although the PT is no longer available to
          download, we are still going to review it and discuss what could have
          become of Silent Hills (the game that the PT was for). </p>

<h3>The Game</h3>
        <p>The game starts off with the Playable Character waking up in a room.
          They get out of the room and walk around a house corridor.when they
          arrive to the last door and open it they are back in the room where
          they started, tring to escape the house will lead to the Character
          waking up at the start again. Although everytime the character goes
          through the corridors in circle more and more supernatural events
          take place in the rooms and looking back would cause a game over since
          they would see a monster that would killthem. </p>

          <p>Some people describe it as though the character is descending to
            madness.</p>

  <p>Also this isn't the actual code for the game i just got</p>

  <h3> My Opinion </h3>

<p>So like most modern game reviewers i did not play this game, however i did
see playthroughs and friends play the game themeselves. So I personally feel
that it is unfortunate that, ok you know what im not going to be typing a review.
im a bit lazy today and i feel as though i should be playing around with code
more beacuse i enjoy that more than typing random stuff that no one will read
anywyas

  <p> and yes we did vote it down here for the fact that it isn't available
    anymore and that it is a teaser so our replayability value goes down. But
    it isn't a bad game, you just can't play it XD</p>

<div>
  <h4> So these are the reasons why we decided to review an unavaiable game<h4>
    <p> because we know that people will ask</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>There isn't many reviews for this game(we know why, but still each
      game deserves a review)</li>
      <li>Silent Hill was a beloved horror franchise and so we here feel as
      though it needs a proper conclusion</li>
      <li>To get people talking about this again since some of the theories
      around it are incredible and should be looked into</li>
      <li>our newst writer (me hi!) is writing this and wanted to test on
        Something</li>
      <li>rying to be a typical reviewer and not having actually played to see
        what work would come out of it </li>
      <li>to annoy you guys.</li>
    </ul>
